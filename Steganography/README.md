# Steganography
 For this part, we used the JS library for steganography with encryption : [Crypto Stego](https://github.com/zeruniverse/CryptoStego) who support least significant bit mode and DCT mode. 


**Note: This JS library needs HTML5 support!**

### How to use it?
* After cloning the repository, you will need to go in the "test/test_launch" directory. 
* Launch the index.html file on a local web page in order to test both actions. This file refers to the two others html : hide.html and reveal.html.

This directory also include a manifest.json used to implements a temporary plugin on Mozilla
